      "The time to begin writing an article is when you have finished it to your satisfaction. By that time you begin to clearly and logically perceive what it is that you really want to say.\n",
      "-- Mark Twain\n",
      "\n",
      "Overview: Writing is a fundamental part of student development and university assessment. Studies indicate that writing proficiency predicts academic success, helps development of critical thinking skills, and is of great importance after formal education in professional and personal settings#. Research also shows that self-regulation is critical to successful writing#. Our opening quote from Mark Twain would resonate with anyone who has struggled with a final draft, while highlighting an expert’s insight into writing as a process. \n",
      "\n",
      "At the university level, most grading addresses a final draft. Some courses incorporate regular draft reviews by instructors or peers, but leave the editing process completely to the student. Strategies and tools that enhance students’ self-regulation during writing would be a significant contribution to students’ academic development. Still, little actionable data is collected that provides students and instructors insight into student strategies during writing. \n",
      "\n",
      "Computer-aided writing research has a history of providing insight into the writing process# and access to data through word processing platforms is becoming easier. Google’s Cloud Platform and the Google Docs API allow for the extraction of highly-detailed revision histories so fine grained that one can literally replay the writing process letter-for-letter#. Such granularity means we can push deeper toward processes and strategies that support effective writing. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our primary interests are studying the temporal nature of revision patterns and how those relate to activities within specific passages of a written text. Such patterns can be used to identify writing strategies that would potentially lead to computer-aided interventions, e.g., automatically asking a student to pause and reflect on the theme of a paragraph. We propose a set of experiments aimed at prototyping infrastructure for tracking letter-to-letter revision history of writers and how revision-history analytics can play a role in supporting writing. Results will serve as a baseline for analytics applications that would eventually be used by students and instructors at Harvard. \n",
      "\n",
      "Technology for Studying Writing: Over the last few decades, researchers have used a wide variety of computational approaches to study writing#, such as keystroke logging. Some researchers go so far as to create virtual environments that not only track keystrokes within a word processor, but overall habits while working from a computer. Such collection requires special attention with regard to privacy and potentially invasive research. \n",
      "\n",
      "We find the use of Google’s Cloud Platform# as a balance between potentially invasive keystroke logging applications and optimal data collection. Since revision histories are only accessible by document owners and collaborators, the share feature gives the user complete control of their data. Additionally, applications can also be created to assign a particular document to a user, and would allow for a disclaimer stating our desire to study the writing process and ask for informed consent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Infrastructure and Experiments: We propose a set of experiments designed to prototype infrastructure for tracking Google Doc revision histories in service of analyzing the writing process. We specifically propose two experiments using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk:\n",
      "Proof of Concept: assigning Google Docs for essay writing for controlled data collection.\n",
      "We will take writing prompts from standardized tests and hand grade responses according to available rubrics (e.g., GRE 30-min Analytical Writing Measures#).\n",
      "We will parse revision histories in order to detect temporal and contextual patterns and correlate those patterns with performance and user backgrounds.\n",
      "Experiments: We will ask users to use the DraftBack browser plugin to replay written essays and go through revisions. Our research questions are: How does watching their own writing process influence their understanding of the writing process and their own habits? How does watching the writing of peers or experts impact students’ own writing? \n",
      "Using collected essays from experiment one - or through expert contributions - we will ask users to revise essays after using the DraftBack tool. We will control this group by asking the same of users but not using DraftBack. \n",
      "In a follow-up experiment, we will randomly assign participants in one of the four conditions to watch revision of their own, an expert, a peer, or none.  We will investigate the impact of watching revisions on their self-regulation and writing. \n",
      "We will measure participants’ self-regulation#, writing self-efficacy#, determine their writing strategies, and collect qualitative self-report data on their experience with DraftBack. \n",
      "\n",
      "Why should HILT fund this proposal? Illuminating the writing process through revision history analytics would provide an innovative tool for instructors and students to better understand writing strategies. As a centrally-administered group (VPAL-Research), our focus is largely around supporting existing educational technologies at Harvard. We view this Spark Grant as helping justify our time in piloting an emerging technology on behalf of Harvard. Several organizations are already paving the way in scaling instructor feedback on final drafts (e.g., WriteLab#, iWrite#, EDM Workshop on Writing Analytics#) and will likely turn their efforts toward revision as such data increases in availability. Tools and results will be presented through workshops and presentations for Harvard faculty and students, and we plan to open source our code and documentation. \n",
